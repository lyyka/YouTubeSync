# Youtube-Sync
Web app that enables you to play youtube videos synced on all your devices

## How to run the app?
As the app is run on node.js server (located in server.js in root of the project), you can run whole app with
```
npm start
```
After that, you can access the app from `localhost:8000` (or which other port you specify in **server.js**)

All of the actions will be logged into the console for tracking the work of server and maybe debug future errors.

**Notice**: you must restart the server with `npm start` each time you make changes to **server.js**
